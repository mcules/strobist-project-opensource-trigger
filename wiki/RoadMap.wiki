#summary Sorting ideas for the next releases.
#sidebar TableOfContents

= Release 1.0 =

 * Prototype working, all mandatory requirements fulfilled 
   * Synch-speed <= 1/250s _(ok!)_
   * Distance > 30m _(ok, but better measurement needed)_
   * Power adjustment only in full stops yet

= Release 1.1 =

 * Tidy up source code
 * Finish documentation

= Release 2 =

 * Personalities: New flashes, new cameras
 * Buzzer for improved user interface
   * additional buzzer
 * Beep on receiver as audio feedback for flash ready 
   * additional optocoupler
   * plug with 4 connectors to get the RDY-signal from the flash
 * Beep on transmitter for “all connected non-zero-strength flashes ready”
   * requires modifications to wireless protocol (“flash ready” polling as 3rd packet  type)
 * Introduce ½ stops of power
 * Protocol choice via UI: High-Speed or Long-Distance ("SH"/"LD")
 * Radio interference indicator
   * Add a value indicator icon to the display
   * Increase the value on each x received but rejected bytes
   * Decrease the value every y seconds
 * Low battery indicator
   * RFM12 provides signal (?)

= Release 3 =

 * Design printed circuit board
 * Add 1,5V -> 3V step-up converter circuit. Only 1 AAA cell needed!
 * Improved synch speed 
   * by means of reading the serial protocol between camera and flash for detecting shutter half-press and initializing the radio communication at that moment 
   * minus intro sequence of 5 byte!
   * possibly switch to one interrupt for every 4 bits (or less) instead of one per received byte
