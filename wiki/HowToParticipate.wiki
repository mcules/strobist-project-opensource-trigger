= How can I get involved? =

 * Join the associated discussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/spot-development
 * Build a pair of SPOTs!
 * Or do it like me: Learn from the stuff others did, sort your priorities, design your own devices and present the world with an enhanced new incarnation.

= Some ideas =

 # Design a PCB (perhaps look at roadmap for Version 2 first, the hardware will change)
 # Adopt this to the devices you need it for (flashes, cameras) and tell us how you did it! 
 # Enhance the trivial (fixed) packet "checksum" (e.g. Hamming 8-4??)
 # Write real-world experience reports (based on the devices _*you*_ built) and spread the word
 # Design a project logo
   * Spotted animals: Dalmatian (friendly, stylish), Cheetah (fast), ...?
   * Something in a "spot" of light: Hot shoe flash, “SPOT”, ...
